# Project Guide: Your Ideas ‚Üí Implementation

This guide shows how each of your project ideas has been implemented in the code.

## üìä Your Ideas & Implementation

### 1. Exploratory Visualization ‚úÖ

**Your Idea:**
> Collect data over hours/days and show time-series plots (morning rush vs. evening rush)

**Implementation:**
- **File:** `visualizations.py`
- **Key Functions:**
  - `plot_hourly_patterns()` - Shows morning vs evening rush with highlighted time periods
  - `plot_time_series_station()` - Time-series plots for individual stations
  - `plot_weekday_vs_weekend()` - Compares patterns across day types
  - `plot_heatmap_by_area()` - Heatmap showing patterns by area and hour

**How to Use:**
```python
from visualizations import BikeVisualizer

viz = BikeVisualizer(df)
viz.plot_hourly_patterns()  # Shows rush hour patterns clearly
```

---

### 2. Regression Models ‚úÖ

**Your Idea:**
> Time Regression: Model bike availability as a function of time of day

**Implementation:**
- **File:** `regression_models.py`
- **Models Included:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Random Forest (best performing)
- **Features Used:**
  - Hour of day (with cyclical encoding)
  - Day of week
  - Weekend indicator
  - Rush hour indicators
  - Time index (for trends)

**How to Use:**
```python
from regression_models import BikeRegressionModels

regressor = BikeRegressionModels(df)
results = regressor.train_time_regression("Station Name")
regressor.plot_model_comparison("Station Name")
regressor.analyze_feature_importance("Station Name")
```

**Output:** R¬≤ scores, RMSE, predictions vs actual, feature importance

---

### 3. Clustering / Spatial Analysis ‚úÖ

**Your Idea:**
> Cluster stations by availability patterns or geographic proximity

**Implementation:**
- **File:** `clustering_spatial.py`
- **Clustering Methods:**
  - K-Means clustering (default)
  - DBSCAN (alternative)
- **Features:** 24-hour availability profiles for each station
- **Analysis:**
  - Cluster visualization (behavioral patterns)
  - Geographic visualization (spatial distribution)
  - PCA analysis (dimensionality reduction)

**How to Use:**
```python
from clustering_spatial import BikeSpatialAnalysis

spatial = BikeSpatialAnalysis(df)
spatial.create_station_profiles()
spatial.cluster_by_availability_patterns(n_clusters=5)
spatial.plot_cluster_patterns()  # Shows behavioral clusters
spatial.plot_spatial_clusters()  # Shows geographic distribution
```

---

### 4. MRT vs Parks/Universities ‚úÖ

**Your Idea:**
> See if stations near MRT exits behave differently from those near parks/universities

**Implementation:**
- **Files:** `clustering_spatial.py` + `visualizations.py`
- **Approach:**
  1. Clustering automatically identifies different station types
  2. Area-level analysis shows patterns by location type
  3. Heatmap visualization shows variation across areas

**How to Identify:**
```python
# After clustering, analyze cluster characteristics
spatial = BikeSpatialAnalysis(df)
spatial.cluster_by_availability_patterns(n_clusters=5)

# See which areas belong to which clusters
cluster_area_dist = spatial.analyze_cluster_by_area()

# Manually identify patterns:
# - Clusters with high morning/low evening = residential/MRT (commuters)
# - Clusters with steady usage = parks/universities (leisure)
# - Clusters with opposite pattern = office areas
```

**Tips for Your Report:**
- Look at cluster patterns and match to known station locations
- MRT stations typically show strong rush hour peaks
- Park stations show more weekend usage
- University stations show steady weekday usage

---

### 5. Compare Weekdays vs Weekends ‚úÖ

**Your Idea:**
> Compare weekdays vs. weekends

**Implementation:**
- **File:** `weekday_weekend_analysis.py`
- **Analyses Included:**
  - Overall pattern comparison
  - Rush hour differences
  - Statistical significance tests (t-test, Mann-Whitney U, KS test)
  - Distribution comparisons
  - Peak usage time identification
  - Area-specific differences

**How to Use:**
```python
from weekday_weekend_analysis import WeekdayWeekendAnalysis

analyzer = WeekdayWeekendAnalysis(df)
analyzer.compare_overall_patterns()
analyzer.compare_rush_hour_patterns()
analyzer.statistical_comparison()  # Provides p-values
analyzer.peak_usage_analysis()
analyzer.compare_by_area()
```

**Statistical Output:** p-values showing significance of differences

---

### 6. Do Nearby Stations Run Out Together? ‚úÖ

**Your Idea:**
> Do nearby stations tend to run out of bikes together?

**Implementation:**
- **File:** `clustering_spatial.py`
- **Function:** `analyze_nearby_correlation()` and `plot_correlation_analysis()`
- **Method:**
  1. Calculate distance matrix between all stations (Haversine formula)
  2. Calculate correlation matrix of occupancy rates
  3. Compare correlations for nearby vs. distant stations
  4. Statistical comparison with visualizations

**How to Use:**
```python
spatial = BikeSpatialAnalysis(df)
spatial.create_station_profiles()
spatial.plot_correlation_analysis(max_distance_km=1.0)

# This will show:
# - Histogram comparing nearby vs far correlations
# - Box plot comparison
# - Mean correlation statistics
```

**Interpretation:**
- Higher correlation for nearby stations = they run out together
- This indicates localized demand patterns
- Useful for rebalancing strategies

## üìÅ Data Collection Strategy

### Option 1: Single Snapshot (Quick Testing)
```python
from data_collector import BikeDataCollector
collector = BikeDataCollector()
df = collector.collect_once()
```
**Use for:** Quick testing, basic exploration

### Option 2: Continuous Collection (Recommended for Project)
```python
from data_collector import BikeDataCollector
collector = BikeDataCollector()

# Collect every 10 minutes for 48 hours (2 days)
collector.collect_continuous(interval_minutes=10, duration_hours=48)
```
**Use for:** Full project analysis, time-series regression, weekday/weekend comparison

### Option 3: Extended Collection (Best Results)
```python
# Run this for 7 days to capture full weekly patterns
collector.collect_continuous(interval_minutes=15, duration_hours=168)
```
**Use for:** Publication-quality results, capturing weekly cycles

## üí° Tips for Your Final Project

### Data Collection
- **Collect for at least 2-3 days** to capture weekday/weekend differences
- **More frequent sampling** (5-10 min intervals) = better time-series analysis
- **Include both weekdays and weekends** for comparison analyses

### Analysis
- **Start with exploratory visualizations** to understand patterns
- **Use statistical tests** (provided in code) to support your claims
- **Compare multiple models** in regression analysis
- **Interpret cluster meanings** by examining station locations

### Presentation
- All plots are **high-resolution** (300 DPI) and publication-ready
- Use **statistical measures** (R¬≤, p-values, RMSE) to quantify findings
- **CSV outputs** can be imported into Excel for tables
- **Color-coded visualizations** clearly show patterns

### Common Issues
- **"Insufficient temporal data"** error ‚Üí Collect data over more time points
- **"No weekday/weekend data"** error ‚Üí Ensure collection spans both
- **Poor regression performance** ‚Üí Need more data samples or temporal variation
